A fun app to mess around with (not final)

many of the things in this app may be buggy, again im a solo dev just doing random shiz.

made with Unreal Engine 5.3.0,
i do not own unreal engine,
unreal is owned by Epic Games Inc.

Requirements:
64 bit processor,
 Geforce GTX 1060,
 Intel Core I5 (whatever version)


Recommended:
Geforce RTX 2060,
Intel Core I5 14400F,
again 64 bit processor,

these things are not needed but it will run smoother.

no data is collected.

el fin.

(ps: dont use this app on a literal toaster.)
